current next step:
    we are currently working on cleaning up the codebase. 
    we want to clean up run_notscheme.py and make that the entry point for the program.
    we want to put the tests currently in notscheme elsewhere

later:
    we want to seperate compilation from execution perhaps
    nscargo for building
    change language base from python to rust
